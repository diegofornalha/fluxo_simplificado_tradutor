  "excerpt": "Artificial Intelligence is transforming how software is created, with tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude changing developer workflows.",
  "content": [
    "Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing software development in unprecedented ways. AI coding assistants are becoming increasingly sophisticated, helping developers write better code faster.",
    "Tools like GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI's technology, can suggest entire functions and blocks of code based on comments or function signatures. Similarly, Claude and other AI assistants can help with code review, debugging, and even architectural decisions.",
    "According to recent surveys, developers using AI tools report up to 40% increase in productivity. These tools are particularly effective for repetitive tasks, boilerplate code, and standard implementations.",
    "However, concerns remain about code quality, security vulnerabilities, and the potential loss of programming skills. Critics argue that over-reliance on AI might lead to developers who don't fully understand the code they're implementing.",
    "The future likely involves collaborative workflows where AI handles routine coding tasks while humans focus on higher-level design, creativity, and quality assurance. This partnership between human creativity and AI efficiency could reshape software development in the decades to come."
